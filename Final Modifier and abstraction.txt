Final is a modifier applicable for classes methods and variable 

final variable
--------------
if the variable is declared as final then we can't reassign that variable.

we can write instance final variable in 3 ways
1. declaring final variable with initialization which is type 1 for instance final variable.
2.inside the instance block for final variable.
3.inside a constructor for final variable

we can write static final variable in 2 ways
1. declaring static final variable while initializationn which is type 1 for static final variable.
2. inside the static block for static final variable

methods
--------
if the method is declared as final we cannot override that method.

class
-------
if the class id declared as final we cannot extend that class inheritance is not supported

abstract classes and abstract methods

abstract modifier
-----------------
abstract is modifier applicable for method and classes but not for variables.

abstract methods
----------------
even though we don't have implementation still we can declare a method with abstract modifier.
that is abstract methods have only declaration but not implementation.
hence abstract method declaration should compulsory ends with semicolon

example
-------
public abstract void methodOne();====>valid.
public abstract void methodTwo(){};====> invalid;

we cannot create the object for the abstract classes because when we create we have to implement abstract classes
